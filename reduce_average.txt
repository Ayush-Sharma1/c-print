Greenhouse gases are emitted through the production and consumption of goods and services. Carbon footprint is a
concept used to quantify the impact of an activity, a person or a country on climate change. How much carbon is emitted
to produce your t-shirt, meal or phone? The amount will depend on production and consumption choices. If we take the
example of transport, taking the plane emits 285g of carbon per kilometre, compared to 104g for a car and 14g for a
train. The same goes for the type of food you eat.

WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?
The world's seven billion people consume varying amounts of the planet's resources. According to the United Nations’
predictions, global population could reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, and over 11 billion by 2100. Growing populations
drive up emissions and deplete the planet’s resources. Increased greenhouse gas emissions have a direct impact on global
warming. It accelerates climate change with disastrous effects on our planet. All of us can contribute to fighting
global warming by making climate-friendly choices in our daily lives.
